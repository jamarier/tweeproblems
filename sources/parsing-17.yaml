title: Testing conditional passages

passages:
  - pass:
      text: |
        Be {{, R = 4.5ohm}}

  - pass:
      text: |
        {{;R}}
  - con:
      - cond: "{{! R  5ohm  < }}"
        cont:
          - pass:
              text: |
                {{,R}} is lower than {{,5ohm}}
          - pass:
              text: |
                So {{,R}} is lower than {{,15ohm}}
      - cond: "{{! R 5ohm >}}"
        cont:
          - con:
              - pass:
                  text: |
                    {{,R}} is greater than {{,5ohm}}
              - pass:
                  text: |
                    So {{,R}} is greater than {{,4.9ohm}}
      - cond: "{{! R 4ohm >}}"
        cont:
          - pass:
              text: |
                {{,R}} is greater than {{,4ohm}}
          - pass:
              text: |
                So {{,R}} is greater than {{,1ohm}}
